# Transferbot
Experiment in conversational banking to learn about interaction using natural language.

A demo can be found at https://seriousme.github.io/transferbot/

The transferbot is composed of 3 parts:
- the AI, provided by https://api.ai
- the (very simplistic) banking backend hosted at https://firebase.google.com/ to maintain balances
- the web frontend hosted using gitHub pages, including voice recognition when using Chrome

The frontend can be easily replaced by other [channels](https://docs.api.ai/docs/integrations) an example being the [default API.ai web agent](https://bot.api.ai/transferbot).
